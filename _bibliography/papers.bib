  abstract={Traditional multi-robot motion planning (MMP) focuses on computing trajectories for multiple robots acting in an environment, such that the robots do not collide when the trajectories are taken simultaneously. In safety-critical applications, a human supervisor may want to verify that the plan is indeed collision-free. In this work, we propose a notion of explanation for a plan of MMP, based on visualization of the plan as a short sequence of images representing time segments, where in each time segment the trajectories of the agents are disjoint, clearly illustrating the safety of the plan. We show that standard notions of optimality (e.g., makespan) may create conflict with short explanations. Thus, we propose meta-algorithms, namely multi-agent plan segmenting-X (MAPS-X) and its lazy variant, that can be plugged on existing centralized sampling-based tree planners X to produce plans with good explanations using a desirable number of images. We demonstrate the efficacy of this explanation-planning scheme and extensively evaluate the performance of MAPS-X and its lazy variant in various environments and agent dynamics.},

  title={Explainability of Multi-Agent Path Finding}, 
  abstract={Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning paths for agents to reach their targets from their start locations, such that the agents do not collide while executing the plan. In safety-critical systems, the plan is typically checked by a human supervisor, who decides on whether to allow its execution. In such cases, we wish to convince the human that the plan is indeed collision-free. To this end, we propose an explanation scheme for MAPF, which bases explanations on the simplicity of visual verification by human’s cognitive process. The scheme decomposes a plan into segments such that within each segment, the agents’ paths are disjoint. We can then convince the supervisor that the plan is collision-free using a small number of images (dubbed an explanation). We can also measure the simplicity of a plan by the number of segments required for the decomposition. We study the complexity of algorithmic problems that arise by the explanation scheme and the tradeoff between the length (makespan) of a plan and its minimal decomposition. We also introduce two centralized1 algorithms for planning with explanations. One is based on a coupled search algorithm similar to A∗, and the other is a decoupled method based on Conflict-Based Search (CBS). We refer to the latter as Explanation-Guided CBS (XG-CBS), which uses a low-level search for individual agents and maintains a high-level conflict tree to guide the low-level search to avoid collisions as well as increasing the number of segments. We propose four approaches to the low-level search of XG-CBS by modifying A∗ for explanations and analyze their effects on the completeness of XG-CBS. Finally, we show the efficacy of the proposed explanation scheme in various MAPF problems and empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed planning algorithms in a series of benchmark problems.},

  title={Introducing Delays in Multi Agent Path Finding}, 
  abstract={We consider a Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) setting where agents have been assigned a plan, but during its execution some agents are delayed. Instead of replanning from scratch when such a delay occurs, we propose delay introduction, whereby we delay some additional agents so that the remainder of the plan can be executed safely. We show that finding the minimum number of additional delays is APX-hard, i.e., it is NP-hard to find a (1 + ε)-approximation for some ε > 0. However, in practice we can find optimal delay-introductions using Conflict-Based Search for very large numbers of agents, and both planning time and the resulting length of the plan are comparable, and sometimes outperform the state-of-the-art heuristics for replanning.},

  title={Chance-Constrained Multi-Robot Motion Planning Under Gaussian Uncertainties}, 
  abstract={We consider a chance-constrained multi-robot motion planning problem in the presence of Gaussian motion and sensor noise. Our proposed algorithm, CC-K-CBS, leverages the scalability of kinodynamic conflict-based search (K-CBS) in conjunction with the efficiency of Gaussian belief trees as used in the Belief- A framework, and inherits the completeness guarantees of Belief- A ’s low-level sampling-based planner. We also develop three different methods for robot-robot probabilistic collision checking, which trade off computation with accuracy. Our algorithm generates motion plans driving each robot from its initial to goal state while accounting for uncertainty evolution with chance-constrained safety guarantees. Benchmarks compare computation time to conservatism of the collision checkers, in addition to characterizing the performance of the planner as a whole. Results show that CC-K-CBS scales up to 30 robots.},

  abstract={Multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) is the fundamental problem of finding non-colliding trajectories for multiple robots acting in an environment, under kinodynamic constraints. Due to its complexity, existing algorithms are either incomplete, or utilize simplifying assumptions. This work introduces Kinodynamic Conflict-Based Search (K-CBS), a decentralized MRMP algorithm that is general, scalable, and probabilistically complete. The algorithm takes inspiration from successful solutions to the discrete analogue of MRMP over finite graphs, known as Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). Specifically, we adapt ideas from Conflict-Based Search (CBS)-a popular decentralized MAPF algorithm-to the MRMP setting. The novelty of our approach is that we work directly in the continuous domain, without discretization. In particular, the kinodynamic constraints are treated natively. K-CBS plans for each robot individually using a low-level planner and grows a conflict tree to resolve collisions between robots by defining constraints. The low-level planner can be any sampling-based, tree-search algorithm for kinodynamic robots, thus lifting existing planners for single robots to the multi-robot setting. We show that K-CBS inherits the (probabilistic) completeness of the low-level planner. We illustrate the generality and performance of K-CBS in several case studies and benchmarks.},

    abstract={The goal of the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem is to find non-colliding paths for agents in an environment, such that each agent reaches its goal from its initial location. In safety-critical applications, a human supervisor may want to verify that the plan is indeed collision-free. To this end, a recent work introduces a notion of explainability for MAPF based on a visualization of the plan as a short sequence of images representing time segments, where in each time segment the trajectories of the agents are disjoint.
    Then, the problem of Explainable MAPF via Segmentation asks for a set of non-colliding paths that admit a short-enough explanation. Explainable MAPF adds a new difficulty to MAPF, in that it is NP-hard with respect to the size of the environment, and not just the number of agents. Thus, traditional MAPF algorithms are not equipped to directly handle Explainable MAPF. In this work, we adapt Conflict Based Search (CBS), a well-studied algorithm for MAPF, to handle Explainable MAPF. We show how to add explainability constraints on top of the standard CBS tree and its underlying A* search. We examine the usefulness of this approach and, in particular, the trade-off between planning time and explainability.},
