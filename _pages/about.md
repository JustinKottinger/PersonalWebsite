I am a Ph.D. student within the Aerospace Engineering Sciences Department at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research occupies the fusion of multi-robot task and motion planning, fault detection and correction, and human interpretable artificial intelligence. My research efforts enable the optimal and robust execution of heterogeneous multi-robot teams to complete high-level mission objectives. In addition to publishing research articles in the aforementioned fields, I've also lectured fellow graduate students in ASEN 5519 “Algorithmic Motion Planning”.

My coursework and extensive research have fostered my expertise in motion and task planning, statistics, prediction, and estimation theory. I find great pride and passion in developing and deploying verifiably safe robotic systems. After obtaining my doctoral degree, I hope to focus my motion and task planning expertise to the field of autonomous vehicles, multi-robot space exploration, or other performance critical robotic applications.
