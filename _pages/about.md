Hello, I'm Justin Kottinger, an ambitious Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Robotics at the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in autonomous robotic motion and task planning. Anticipating the completion of my Ph.D. in Robotics by the summer of 2024, my academic journey includes a B.A. in Physics and Minor in Mathematics from Whittier College, complemented by an M.S. in Aerospace Engineering with a focus in Autonomous Systems from the University of Colorado Boulder.

My expertise encompasses motion planning and task planning for both single and multi-robot teams, a proficiency refined through courses like "Algorithmic Motion Planning," "Decision Making Under Uncertainty," and "Verification and Synthesis of Stochastic Systems." This expertise is not just theoretical; I've contributed significantly to the field through several research publications and active involvement in the development of the "Open Motion Planning Library," a popular C++ framework for motion planning utilized in both industry and research tasks.

In the professional domain, my skills extend beyond academic research. I am well-versed in continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD) tools, utilizing Jira and Git for efficient project management. I have successfully implemented code for safe autonomous flight on an omni-directional drone while working as an Auontomous Systems Engineer Intern at the Aerospace Corporation. I also work part-time as a robotic navigation software engineer for Trimble Corporation's autonomous agriculture equipment development team where I have enhanced the line-acquisition software for autonomous agricultural equipment.

Having actively engaged in projects that bridge the gap between academia and industry, I am eager to apply my comprehensive skill set to industry challenges, contributing to the advancement of autonomous robotics. Join me on this journey as we shape the future of autonomous systems together!
