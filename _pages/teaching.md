Welcome to my teaching page! As an enthusiastic educator, I have had the privilege of teaching courses in algorithmic motion planning, a field that lies at the intersection of theory and real-world applications in robotics. My teaching philosophy revolves around fostering an interactive and engaging learning environment. I emphasize practical insights by incorporating live demonstrations, hands-on activities, and real-world examples into my classes. With a focus on student engagement, I've designed and delivered lectured that not only cover the theoretical foundations but also provide practical skills through live demonstrations. The classroom is not just a space for learning; it's an arena for exploration, collaboration, and the application of knowledge. Below is a list of lectures that I've developed and delivered to make the learning experience meaningful and impactful. Please reach out if you are interested in recieving any of these materials.

1. **Fall 2022 Algorithmic Motion Planning**: Introduction to the Open Motion Planning Library
2. **Fall 2022 Algorithmic Motion Planning**: OMPL Live Demonstration
3. **Fall 2022 Algorithmic Motion Planning**: Multi-Robot Motion Planning
4. **Fall 2023 Algorithmic Motion Planning**: Introduction to the Open Motion Planning Library (Improved)
5. **Fall 2023 Algorithmic Motion Planning**: OMPL Live Demonstration (Improved)
